## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`
3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   \`\`\`
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
   \`\`\`
4. Set up the database schema:
   \`\`\`bash
   npx prisma db push
   \`\`\`
5. Run the development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Showing Up

- Make sure the bot has the `applications.commands` scope
- Check that the commands were registered by visiting `/api/discord/register` or `/api/discord/force-register`
- Commands can take up to an hour to propagate globally

### Permission Errors

- Ensure the bot has all the required permissions
- Check that the bot's role is higher in the hierarchy than the roles it's trying to manage
- For role management, the bot cannot modify roles that are higher than its own role

### Logging Not Working

- Make sure you've set up logging with `/logging set #channel`
- Verify the bot has permission to send messages in the logging channel
- Check the Vercel logs for any errors

### GitHub Webhook Issues

- Verify the GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches between Vercel and GitHub
- Ensure the repository format is correct (owner/repo)
- Check that the bot has permission to send messages in the webhook channel
- Review GitHub webhook delivery logs for errors

### Database Issues

- Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct and properly formatted
- Make sure your database is accessible from Vercel
- Check for Prisma errors in the Vercel logs
- The database schema will be automatically created on deployment
